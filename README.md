# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Using-Fibonacci-Heap
Dijkstra's original shortest path algorithm does not use a priority queue, and runs in O(V ) time. When using a Fibonacci heap as a priority queue, it runs in O(E + V log V) time, which is asymptotically the fastest known time complexity for this problem.
